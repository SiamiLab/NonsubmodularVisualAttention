Anticipated VINS-Mono
=====================

During aggressive maneuvers, vision-based perception techniques tend to fail because of the lack of tracked features. The purpose of this work is to mitigate loss of feature tracks by being more clever with which features are selected for use in the optimization. By doing so, we add robustness to the visual-inertial motion estimation because features that are likely to be soon lost based on future motion are not selected. Further, we allow for more efficient optimization by using fewer features with high information content.
