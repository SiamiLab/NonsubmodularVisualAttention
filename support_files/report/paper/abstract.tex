\begin{abstract}
The theory of an intelligent feature selection front end for visual-inertial navigation tasks is discussed.
By using the attention and anticipation algorithms of Carlone~\cite{Carlone2017}, we are able to select features that minimize state estimation uncertainty.
Features are selected according to their information content, allowing fewer features to be processed by an optimization back end.
Using VINS-Mono, a C++ implementation of the attention and anticipation algorithm is given.
