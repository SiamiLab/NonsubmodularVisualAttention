\section{Overview of VINS-Mono}\label{sec:vinsmono}

VINS-Mono is a state-of-the-art nonlinear optimization-based VIO system and includes a loop closure module for a SLAM system.
It is a pose-graph-optimization-based VIO that uses preintegrated IMU factors for its sliding window estimator, and is generally shown to be accurate and efficient~\cite{Delmerico2018}.

The VINS-Mono system includes modules for initialization, tracking and IMU preintegration, VIO back end, and an optional loop closure module.
The entire system is real-time and has been run on-board multirotors.

For this project, the desired characteristics of the VIO system included that it be state-of-the-art, accurate, and potential for research use in the future.
VINS-Mono fit this criteria, and is considered to be one of the best monocular VIO systems at this time.
Delmerico and Scaramuzza found VINS-Mono to be the most accurate, robust, and consistent across hardware platforms, though also one of the more resource-intensive VIO systems~\cite{Delmerico2018}.
We decided to use VINS-Mono for the VIO system while adding our components to the system architecture as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:architecture}.
