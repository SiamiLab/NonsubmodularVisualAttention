\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
Overall, our contributions are a C++ implementation of the attention and anticipation paper~\cite{Carlone2017} and an integration of this algorithm with the state-of-the-art VIO system, VINS-Mono.
The code is open-source and available on GitHub.

Future work involves adding $\OmegakkH^\text{PRIOR}$ to the algorithm and looking at the VINS-Mono to test if this improves performance.
Moreover, future avenues for research include looking at how control can be incorporated rather than using the ground truth for future state horizon and looking at the dual problem of minimizing the features used to achieve performance requirements which would be very useful in the resource-constrained scenario.
